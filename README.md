### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Project title: Song lyrics text mining for racial discrimination
+ This project is conducted by Yizhen Xu (yx2470)

+ Project summary: The main topic of this project is to analyze the racial discrimination words,including chink,nigger&nigga,spic,honky,kika and wetback. And the main topic can be divided into two parts:1.The level of racial discrimination of each genre, indicated as the number of such words. 2.How many racial descrimination words used for each race? With one more step data cleaning job, eliminating outliers based on length of lyrics, I do a exploratory data analysis. The conclusions are that 1.Hip-Hop song has an overwhelming use of discrimination words and 2.it seems like the African Americans are disrespected most bacause of the highest fequency of n-word.
